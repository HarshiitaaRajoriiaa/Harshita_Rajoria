            Hi, I’m Harshita Rajoria — a Computer Science Engineering student at
            IGDTUW, currently in my pre-final year, specializing in Artificial
            Intelligence
          </p>

          <p>
            I enjoy crafting user-friendly web applications using Java,
            JavaScript, React, and Tailwind CSS, and I’m actively improving my
            skills in Data Structures and Algorithms. I frequently take part in
            coding contests and love challenging myself with logical problems.
          </p>

          <p>
            Beyond academics, I’m someone who genuinely enjoys talking to new
            people, understanding different perspectives, and learning through
            conversations. My friends often describe me as a good listener,
            strong communicator, and someone with great management skills—traits
            that I believe are just as important as technical expertise.
          </p>

          <p>
            In my personal time, you’ll usually find me reading books like
            Atomic Habits by James Clear, Think Like a Monk by Jay Shetty, The
            Bhagavad Gita, and Life’s Amazing Secrets by Gaur Gopal Das. I also
            love solving Sudoku, playing chess, and working on becoming a better
            version of myself every day.
          </p>

          <p>
            {" "}
            I’m currently seeking opportunities where I can combine my tech
            knowledge, creativity, and interpersonal skills to contribute
            meaningfully to real-world projects.
